                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p class="text-squish">Hello! My name is Robert Teets, and I am a 25 year old ski bum and software developer. I am currently residing in the beautiful state of Colorado! I've been 'coding' since about 2008, though my projects back then were a lot less... educated. I originally picked up the hobby of coding on a game called Roblox, where I primarily messed around with development in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)">Lua</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-squish">Following my early development of my interest in coding, I began trying to expand that knowledge. I spent a good couple years learning to mod games like Garry's Mod using Lua, but quickly realized I was limited by what those games were possible of. This is where I began learning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">C#</a>, as well as it's uses within <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)">Unity.</a></p>
                <p class="text-squish">Most recently, however, I learned of a coding boot camp called <a href="https://www.codingdojo.com/">Coding Dojo</a>. Currently, I am in the process of learning three different full stacks of technology, ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a>, and <a href="https://wikitia.com/wiki/MERN_(solution_stack)">MERN</a> ), and I am hoping to fully develop this age-old interest into a career. </p>
